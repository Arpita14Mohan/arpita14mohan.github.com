<p>My name is Arpita Mohan and I have been a part of the IT industry close to 4 years. Few days back I read an article which said that "Blogging can improve your technical skills". Reason being "Blogging can provide you with a repository for your knowledge". So I thought of trying technical blogging and I hope it would be worth of knowledge for me and people who use it.</p>
<p><em>Why UNIX?</em></p>
<span>This is a very obvious question for the developers who are used to work on Windows. So when I started working on Unix , the first thing I did was to get an answer of "Why Unix"?<br/>
UNIX is "multi-user".<br/>
Unlike MS-DOS, OS/2, and Windows NT, UNIX is a multi-user operating system. This means that multiple users can log in to a computer at one time, and use the resources of that computer. Resources can be a machine, CPU, software applications, as well as a hard disk drives, printers, modems, etc.
</br/>I have tried out these very basic  Unix commands and think they would be of help for the beginners in this field.</span>
<p><em>Useful Unix Commands</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>Ctrl-h : Erase or backspace over character; note the CTRL-key and h-key must be simultaneously pressed.</li>
    <li>Ctrl-c : Interrupt or break character; stops printing and returns to UNIX. </li>
    <li>Ctrl-c : Interrupt or break character; stops printing and returns to UNIX. </li>
    <li>Ctrl-w : Word erase character .</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Unix Control-Key Commands</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>Open Last Edited File Using ls -t</li>
    <li>Display One File Per Line Using ls -1</li>
    <li>Display All Information About Files/Directories Using ls -l</li>
    <li>Display File Size in Human Readable Format Using ls -lh</li>
    <li>Display Directory Information Using ls -ld</li>
    <li>Order Files Based on Last Modified Time Using ls -lt</li>
    <li>Order Files Based on Last Modified Time (In Reverse Order) Using ls -ltr</li>
    <li>Display Hidden Files Using ls -a (or) ls -A</li>
    <li>Display Files Recursively Using ls -R</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Redirecting input and output</em></p>
<b>command1 > file1</b><br/>
executes command1, placing the output in file1. This will clobber any existing data in file1.<br/>
<b>cat >> file1.txt</b><br/>
To append output to the end of the file, use the >> operator</br/>
<b>cat < file1.txt > file2.txt</b></br> 
combines the two capabilities: command1 reads from file1.txt and writes to file2.txt</br>
<p><em>Redirecting to mulitple outputs</em></p>
<b>ls -lrt | tee xyz</b></br>
The standard command tee can redirect output from a command to several destinations.This directs the file list output to both standard output and the file xyz.
