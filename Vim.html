<p>Hi All,<br/>
I am very used to using Notepad++. So when I got a chance to work on VIM editor, I thought why not give it a chance too. Before proceeding with vim, I cleared my concepts by working on the examples mentioned in Vim Tutor. They are sufficient to atleast clear up the basics of vim.  Then I started working on few of the examples which are mentioned below and can help users when exploring vim editor.</p>
<p><em><b>Dealing with Multiple Files</b></em></p>
<span>You can specify multiple files on the command line, as follows:
</br>
</span>
<p><em>$ vim one.c two.c</em></p>
<span>This command starts Vim  and tells it that you will be editing two files.
By default,Vim displays just the first file.
To edit the next file, you need to change files using the mentioned command.</span><br/>
<p><em>:next</em></p>
<span>If you have unsaved changes in the current file and you try to do a :next,
you will get a warning message and the :next  will not work.
You can solve this problem and save the file using the following command:</span></br>
<p><em>:write</em></p>
<span>In other words, you can perform a :write  followed by a :next.
The Vim  editor has a shorthand command for this.The following command performs both operations:</span></br>

<span>Or, you can force Vim  to go the next file using the force (!) option. If you use the
