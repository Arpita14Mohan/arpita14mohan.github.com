<p>Hi All,<br/>
Today I will be covering the different aspects of Version Control. There are many version controls available in the market as per your specific project requirement. Let me tell you my experience on different version controls. Initially I started with VSS (Visual Source Safe). Then switched on to TFS (Team Foundation Server specific to .Net development) and moved on to SVN ( Sub Version). As a developer I like to explore. So I have started using GitHub. But first of all let me give you some information about version control.</p>
<p><em><b>What is Version Control?</b></em></p>
<span>A version control system is a combination of technologies and practices for tracking and controlling changes to a project's files, in particular to source code, documentation, and web pages.
</br>
</span>
<p><em><b>Why do we use Version Control?</b></em></p>
<span>
As the defination suggests, it is used to maintain the configuration of various files related to the project. It can be a SRS document, source codes, bug tracking, release management etc.Identifying each discrete change made to the project's files, in addition to change's date and the author who made that change. 
</span>
<p><em><b>Centralized VCS versus Decentralized VCS</b></em></p>
<span>
In CVCS, there is just One Tree Source. All developers work (checkout) from that source, and then add(commit) their changes in the same One Tree Source.
In DVCS, each working copy has its own repository. You make changes and commit them. This commit will secure the changes in your local working repository. The push command will commit your changes in the Server Repository.
<br/><br/>
For the past few years I have worked on CVSes so I am quite new to Git Hub and have just started exploring Git Hub. Setting Up an account, Creating a Repository, Collaborating with other team members are the first few things which I tried on the first day. The next step was creating branches. Going deep into branches. How to resolve conflicts, how does merging happen etc? The Pro Git book is extremely helpful for the beginners in Git Hub. It covers topics like Git Basics, Git on the Server and Git Branching and so on. I too practiced the commands mentioned in the book and found them really helpful to clear my doubts on merging and branching.
</br></br>
While going through some articles on github I came across a very intersting information where it was mentioned that Git Hub can be used for bolgging purpose also. Git Hub provides you with  service called GitHub pages. With pages you can use a Git repository to publish web contents. All you need to do is create a Git repository with a special naming (your-username.github.com) and everything pushed to this repository will be published under http://your-username.github.com. Haven't tried this yet but thinking of doing it sooner as and when time permits.
</br></br>
Found out a very site where there were surveys conducted on different version control systems, covering attributes like Which VCS people prefer, Which programming language they are proficient with, Did you find Git easy to learn and many more.
